We assume the device owner has four expense categories 
related to the device:
the capital cost of the device ($C_{cap}$), 
the annual cost of the energy service ($C_s$), 

one expense category for all other goods and services, 
income, and net savings.


Each cost category is analyzed in perpetuity, with
capital and disposal costs applied at the beginning and end, 
respectively, of the device lifetime ($t_{life}$), and
energy service and operations and maintencance costs
applied at the beginning of each year.
Similarly, other costs, income, and net savings are 
applied at the beginning of each year.
