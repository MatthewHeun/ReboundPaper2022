**** Price effect derivation here. ****

The energy price effect is caused by a reduction 
in energy price ($p_E$)
that can occur when implementation of an EEU
leads to an economy-wide reduction in energy demand.
The device owner spends less on energy purchases, 
leading to additional freed cash
that is spent on other goods and services
with energy imnplications 
at the energy intensity of the economy ($I_E$).
This appendix derives an expression for 
price-effect rebound ($Re_{p_E}$).

The derivation begins with an estimate of the new economy-wide 
demand for energy ($\rainc{Q}_E$).

\begin{equation}
  \rainc{Q}_E = \rbempl{Q}_E - N_{dev} f_{\EEU} \rbempl{E}_s \left( 1 - \frac{\rainc{E}_s}{\rbempl{E}_s} \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
%
where
$\rate{Q}_E$ is the rate of economy-wide demand for energy in MJ/year,
$N_{dev}$ is the number of devices in service, 
$f_{\EEU}$ is the fraction of devices upgraded across the economy
(i.e., the penetration of the EEU), and
$\rate{E}_s$ is the rate of energy consumption by a single device in MJ/year.
The decorations $\circ$ and $-$ have the usual meanings
provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}, namely 
$\circ$ indicates the original, pre-EEU device, and 
$-$ indicates conditions after 
emplacement, substitution, and income
adjustments.
The ratio of new to pre-EEU demand for energy is given by

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\rainc{Q}_E}{\rbempl{Q}_E} =
        \frac{\rbempl{Q}_E - N_{dev} f_{\EEU} \rbempl{E}_s \left( 1 - \frac{\rainc{E}_s}{\rbempl{E}_s}  \right)}
        {\rbempl{Q}_E}
\end{equation}

% \frac{  \left( 1 - \frac{}{} \right)}{\rbempl{Q}_E}}

due to widespread penetration ($f_{\EEU}$) of the EEU,
expressed as a ratio.

In Section~\ref{sec:notes_price_effect}, 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:price_effect}) gives
price effect rebound ($Re_{p_E}$)
as a function of the energy price change.

\begin{equation}
  Re_{p_E} = \frac{\left(1 - \frac{\ainc{p}_E}{\bempl{p}_E}\right) \orig{p}_E \rainc{E}_s I_E}{\Sdot} \, .  \tag{\ref{eq:price_effect}}
