Readme for the working paper submission.

The working paper was submitted in September 2022.  
The final version (with the correct Leeds data repository link) was sent to IAEE in November 2022.  
So, rolling back the repository to 9 November 2022 should obtain the version of the paper
that was submitted to the IAEE working paper series.
