%% Abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
Widespread implementation of energy efficiency
is a key greenhouse gas emissions mitigation measure, 
but rebound can ``take back'' energy savings.
However, the absence of solid analytical foundations hinders
empirical determination of the size of rebound.
In Part~I, we developed foundations of 
a rigorous analytical framework
that is approachable for both energy analysts and economists. 
In this paper (Part~II of two),
we develop energy, expenditure, and consumption planes, 
a novel, mutually consistent, and numerically precise
way to visualize and illustrate rebound.
Further, we operationalize the macro factor
for macroeconomic rebound. 
Using the framework and rebound planes,
we calculate and show total rebound for two examples: 
energy efficiency upgrades of
a car (56.2\%) and
an electric lamp (67.0\%).
We calculate rebound for a producer-sided extension
to the framework, 
namely an energy price rebound effect.
Finally, we provide information about new open source software tools 
for calculating magnitudes and
visualizing rebound effects using the framework.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Part I of this two-part paper, we argued that improved clarity is needed
about energy rebound.
We said that
%
\begin{quote}
  [a] description of rebound [is needed] that is
  %
  \begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

    \item consistent across energy, expenditure, and consumption aspects,

    \item technically rigorous and

    \item approachable from both sides
          (economics and energy analysis). \ldots

  \end{enumerate*}
  %
  In other words,
  the finance and human behavior aspects of rebound need to be presented
  in ways energy analysts can understand.
  And the energy aspects of rebound need to be presented
  in ways economists can understand.
\end{quote}

To help improve clarity in the rebound field,
we developed in Part~I foundations for
a rigorous analytical framework,
one that is tractable for both energy analysts and economists.
Three aspects of rebound are analyzed in the framework:
energy, expenditure, and consumption.
The framework contains both
direct and indirect rebound and
four rebound effects
(emplacement, substitution, income, and macro)
between five stages ($\circ$, $*$, $\wedge$, $-$, and $\sim$).
Rebound terms and symbol decorations are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}.
(See Table~\ref{PartI-tab:rebound_typology} in Part~I for details.
See Appendix~\ref{sec:nomenclature} for nomenclature.)

\label{fig:flowchart}
\end{figure}

In this paper (Part~II), we make further progress toward the goal of clarity
with five contributions.
First, we develop a new way to communicate
components and mechanisms of rebound
via mutually consistent and numerically precise
visualizations of rebound effects
in energy, expenditure, and consumption planes.
Second, we calculate the macro rebound effect
via a macro factor ($k$) selected to be 3.
Third, we apply the framework to two energy efficiency upgrades (EEUs)
(a car and an electric lamp)
with detailed explication
of numerical results for the examples.
Fourth, we apply the framework to
calculate numerical values
for the producer-sided energy price rebound
extension to the framework.
Finally, we provide information
about new open source software tools
for calculating and visualizing rebound
for any energy efficiency upgrade.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:methods} describes data for the examples,
our method of visualizing rebound, and
open source software tools for calculating and visualizing rebound.
Section~\ref{sec:results} provides results for two examples:
energy efficiency upgrades to a car and an electric lamp.
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} operationalizes the macro factor ($k$)
and discusses results, and
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Data and methods}
\label{sec:methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section contains data for the examples
(Section~\ref{sec:data}),
an explication of our new method for visualizing rebound effects and magnitudes
(Section~\ref{sec:path_graphs}), and
a description of new open source software tools
for rebound calculations and visualization
(Section~\ref{sec:software_tools}).


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Data}
\label{sec:data}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To demonstrate application of the rebound analysis framework
developed in Part~I,
we analyze two examples:
energy efficiency upgrades to a car and an electric lamp.
The examples are presented with much detail
to support our goal of helping to advance clarity for the process
of calculating the magnitude of rebound effects.
Here, we collect parameter values
for the equations to calculate
nine rebound components:
$Re_{dempl}$,
$Re_{emb}$,
$Re_{\om}$,
$Re_d$,
$Re_{dsub}$,
$Re_{isub}$,
$Re_{dinc}$,
$Re_{iinc}$, and
$Re_{\macro}$.
Total rebound
($Re_{tot}$)
is given by the sum of the above components
or equivalently by Eq.~(\ref{PartI-eq:Re_tot}) of Part~I.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Data for car example}
\label{sec:data_car_example}
%------------------------------



For the first example,
we consider the purchase of a more fuel efficient car,
namely a gasoline-electric Ford Fusion Hybrid car,
to replace a conventional gasoline Ford Fusion car.
The cars are matched as closely as possible,
except for the inclusion of an electric battery
in the hybrid car.
The car case study features a larger initial capital investment ($\orig{C}_{cap} < \amacro{C}_{cap}$)
for the long-term benefit of decreased energy service costs ($\rorig{C}_s > \ramacro{C}_s$).

We require three sets of data.
First, basic car parameters are summarized
in Table~\ref{tab:car_parameters}.
Second, we require several general economic parameters,
mainly relating to the U.S.\ economy and personal finances
%of the average U.S.\ citizen,
of a representative U.S.-based user
shown in Table~\ref{tab:car_economic_parameters}.
Third, we require elasticity parameters,
as given in Table~\ref{tab:car_elasticity_parameters}.

\subsubsection{Data for lamp example}
\label{sec:data_lamp_example}
%------------------------------




For the second example,
we consider purchasing a Light Emitting Diode (LED) electric lamp
to replace a baseline incandescent electric lamp.
Both lamps are matched as closely as possible
in terms of energy service delivery (measured in lumen output per lamp),
the key difference being the energy required to provide that service.
The LED lamp has a low
initial capital investment rate
when spread out over the lifetime of the lamp
(less than the incumbent incandescent lamp)
and a long-term benefit of decreased direct energy expenditures
at approximately the same energy service delivery rate (\lmhr/yr).

Again, three sets of data are required.
First, basic lamp parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_parameters}.
Second, several general economic parameters,
mainly relating to the U.S.\ economy and
personal finances
of a representative U.S.-based user are
given in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_economic_parameters}.
Third, we require the elasticity parameters,
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_elasticity_parameters}.

\subsection{Visualization}
\label{sec:path_graphs}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A rigorous rebound analysis should track
energy, expenditure, and consumption
aspects of rebound
at the device (direct rebound) and elsewhere in the economy (indirect rebound)
across adjustments for all rebound effects
(emplacement, substitution, income, and macro).
Doing so involves many terms and much complexity.

To date, visualizing the energy, expenditure, and consumption
aspects of rebound phenomena has not been
done in a numerically precise manner
with a set of mutually consistent graphs.
So we introduce \emph{rebound planes}
to help advance clarity of
(direct and indirect) rebound and
adjustments (via emplacement, substitution, income, and macro effects)
across all aspects (energy, expenditure, and consumption).
Each aspect is represented by a path in its own plane,
showing adjustments in response to the EEU.
The order of presentation below is
energy first, followed by expenditure, ending with consumption,
because the EEU triggers rebound
(the topic of this article and visible in the energy plane),
but is caused by expenditures on the EEU and further monetary adjustments
(visible in the expenditure plane),
which are calculated via details about substitution
(visible in the consumption plane).

Axes of the rebound planes
represent direct and indirect effects, with
direct effects shown on the $x$-axes, and
indirect effects shown on the $y$-axes.
Specifically,
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

  \item direct and indirect energy consumption rates ($\rate{E}_{dir}$, $\rate{E}_{indir}$) are placed on
        the $x$- and $y$-axes of the energy plane, respectively;

  \item direct and indirect expenditure rates ($\rate{C}_{dir}$ and $\rate{C}_{indir}$,
        discounted for beginning of life and end of life costs) are placed on
        the $x$- and $y$-axes of the expenditure plane, respectively; and

  \item the indexed consumption rate of the energy service ($\rate{q}_s$) and
        the indexed expenditure rate of other consumption goods ($\rate{C}_o$) are placed on
        the $x$- and $y$-axes of the consumption plane, respectively.

\end{enumerate*}
%
Paths through energy, expenditure, and consumption planes
consist of segments that represent changes due to the various rebound effects.
Table~\ref{tab:path_graph_segments} provides the key for rebound path segments.
Effects that include both direct and indirect rebound
will show displacement along both axes and
create a path in the $x$-$y$ plane.
See Appendix~\ref{sec:graph_details} for
detailed mathematical descriptions for constructing paths on the rebound planes, and
see Section~\ref{sec:results} for rebound path graphs
for EEU examples of a car and an electric lamp.

Each rebound plane is described in the subsections below.
Reference to the rebound planes in
Figs.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph}--\ref{fig:LampConsGraph}
below will be beneficial.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{The energy plane}
\label{sec:energy_path_graphs}
%------------------------------

The energy plane
(see Figs.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph} and~\ref{fig:LampEnergyGraph} below)
shows the direct energy consumption rate ($\rate{E}_{dir}$) on the $x$-axis
and
the indirect energy consumption rate ($\rate{E}_{indir}$) on the $y$-axis.%
\footnote{
  A related, notional-only (not quantified as in Section~\ref{sec:results}),
  one-dimensional visualization of direct and indirect energy rebound
  (but not on expenditure or consumption planes)
  can be found in Fig.~1 of \cite{Exadaktylos:2021aa}.}
%
Points $\circ$, $*$, $\wedge$, $-$, and $\sim$ represent stages
between the rebound effects of Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}.
Points $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ represent intermediate stages.
Lines with negative slope through points
$\circ$, $a$, $*$, $\wedge$, $-$, and $\sim$
indicate energy consumption isoquants
at key points.
Note that segment \bartilde{} appears only in the energy plane,
because the framework tracks energy consumption but not expenditures or consumption
for the macro effect.

In the energy plane,
point $a$ lies on the $Re_{tot} = 0\%$ line
indicating that point $a$ (and the $Re_{tot} = 0\%$ line)
is the point from which all rebound effects
($Re_{empl}$, $Re_{sub}$, $Re_{inc}$, and $Re_{\macro}$)
are measured.
If rebound effects cause
total energy demand to return to the original energy consumption level
(negative sloping line through the $\circ$ point),
all expected energy savings are taken back by rebound effects.
Thus, the line of constant energy consumption through the $\circ$ point is labeled
$Re_{tot} = 100\%$.
The contribution of each rebound effect to total rebound
is represented by the distance that each component's segment
moves across the rebound isoquants.
Total rebound ($Re_{tot}$) is measured linearly between and beyond the
$Re_{tot} = 0\%$ and $Re_{tot} = 100\%$ lines,
with direct rebound in the $x$ direction and
indirect rebound in the $y$ direction.
The region below and to the left of the $Re_{tot} = 0\%$ line
exhibits negative rebound, indicating hyperconservation.
The region above and to the right of the $Re_{tot} = 100\%$ line
shows backfire,
i.e., greater total energy consumption after the EEU than before it.

Segment \starc{} moves in the negative $y$ direction
by definition of the indirect substitution effect,
and segment \chat{} moves in the positive $x$ direction
by the definition of the direct substitution effect.
Both income effect segments (\hatd{} and \dbar{})
show more energy consumption, because net savings are spent
on goods and services that rely on at least some energy consumption.%
\footnote{
  We exclude the case of an inferior good, whose consumption decreases
  as real income increases, but
  we note here the possibility of such behavior.
  This behavior would
  however require a different utility model
  besides the CES utility model,
  which we use throughout this analysis.
}
%
Segment \bartilde{} always moves in the positive $y$ direction,
because macro effects lead to additional indirect energy consumption.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{The expenditure plane}
\label{sec:expenditure_path_graphs}
%------------------------------

The expenditure plane (see Figs.~\ref{fig:CarCostGraph} and~\ref{fig:LampCostGraph} below) shows
the direct expenditure rate on the energy service ($\rate{C}_{dir}$) on the $x$-axis and
the indirect expenditure rate
($\rate{C}_{indir}$, discounted when appropriate)
on the $y$-axis.
Lines with negative slope through points $\circ$, $a$, $*$, and $\wedge$
indicate expenditure isoquants.
The line through the $\circ$ point is an isoquant for the
cost of purchasing the original consumption bundle
at the original prices.
The line through the $*$ point is an isoquant for the
cost of purchasing the original consumption bundle
at the new prices.
Segments \ab{} and \bstar{}
could both move in the positive $y$ direction,
they could both move in the negative $y$ direction, or
they could move in opposite directions,
depending on the results of the independent analyses for
embodied energy and capital cost rates.
The substitution effect along segments \starc{} and \chat{}
will together, by definition, lead to lower expenditure
due to the energy service price decline and
the budget-reducing compensating variation (CV).
The income effect (segments \hatd{} and \dbar{}) must bring expenditure
back to the original expenditure line
(equal to the budget constraint set by income in dollar or nominal terms)
by assumptions about non-satiation and utility maximization
in the device user's decision function.


%------------------------------
\subsubsection{The consumption plane}
\label{sec:consumption_path_graphs}
%------------------------------

The consumption plane
(Figs.~\ref{fig:CarConsGraph} and~\ref{fig:LampConsGraph} below) shows
the indexed rate of energy service consumption ($\rate{q}_s/\rbempl{q}_s$) on the $x$-axis and
the indexed rate of other goods consumption ($\rate{C}_o/\rbempl{C}_o$) on the $y$-axis.
Iso-expenditure loci of indexed energy service and other goods demand,
i.e. budget constraints,
are shown as lines with negative slope
(lines \circcirc{}, \starstar{}, \hathat{}, and \barbar{}).
Note that budget constraints \circcirc{} and \barbar{}
intersect at the $y$-axis (i.e., where $x$ = 0),
because the prices of other goods and services do not change
as a result of the EEU.
Emplacement (by itself) does not alter consumption patterns, so
the rate of energy service consumption and
the rate of other goods consumption are
unchanged across the emplacement effect
($\rbempl{q}_s = \raempl{q}_s$ and $\rbempl{C}_o = \raempl{C}_o$, respectively).
Thus,
only movements after the $*$ point are visible as a path in the consumption plane, and
points $\circ$, \emph{a}, \emph{b}, and $*$
collapse to the same location in the consumption plane.

Indifference curves for the CES utility model
are denoted by \iicirc{} and \iibar{}
and represent lines of constant utility through the $\circ$ and $-$ points.
Prior to the EEU, the consumption basket (of the energy service and other goods)
is represented by the $\circ$ point.
The budget constraint,
here in real terms, i.e.,
the capacity to purchase either the energy service or other goods and services,
is shown as isoquant \circcirc{}.
The original budget constraint line (\circcirc{})
is tangent to the original indifference curve
(\iicirc{}) at point $\circ$, the optimal consumption
bundle prior to the EEU.
The real budget line \starstar{}
indicates the (higher) capacity to purchase
combinations of energy services and other goods and services
using the same money needed to purchase
the old consumption bundle but at the new, lower price
for the energy service,
thanks to the EEU.

The substitution effect leads to the cheaper, optimal
CES-utility-preserving
consumption bundle at the $\wedge$ point.
The substitution effect is shown by segments
\starc{} (the indirect component, which represents the decrease in other goods consumption) and
\chat{} (the direct component, which represents the increase in energy service consumption).
Although the substitution effect is calculated
in the consumption plane,
its impact
can be seen in
the energy and expenditure planes.

In the consumption plane,
the income expansion path under the CES utility model
is a ray (\rr{}) from the origin through the $\wedge$ point
in the consumption plane.
The pre- and post-income-effect
points ($\wedge$ and $-$, respectively)
lie along the \rr{} ray, due to homotheticity.
The increased consumption rate of the energy service is
represented by segment \hatd{}, and
the increased consumption rate of other goods and services is
represented by segments \dbar{}.

Under non-homothetic utility models,
the income expansion path will be closer to vertical
in the consumption plane,
as the device owner spends more net income ($\rasub{N}$)
on other goods and less on the energy service.
In the limit, consumption of the energy service
is already satiated, so
net income is spent completely on other goods,
resulting in a vertical income expansion path.

\subsection{Software tools}
\label{sec:software_tools}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We developed an open source \texttt{R} package called \texttt{ReboundTools}
to standardize and distribute the methods for calculating rebound magnitudes in our framework.
\texttt{ReboundTools} can be found at \url{https://github.com/MatthewHeun/ReboundTools}.
(See \citet{Heun:2023aa}.)
\texttt{ReboundTools} provides functions for
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

  \item reading input data from a spreadsheet,

  \item performing rebound calculations, and

  \item generating rebound tables and rebound planes.

\end{enumerate*}
%
\texttt{ReboundTools} was used for
all calculations and all rebound planes in this paper.

To find the path to an example spreadsheet bundled with the package,
users of \texttt{ReboundTools}
can call the function \texttt{ReboundTools::sample\_eeu\_data\_path()}.
After filling the example spreadsheet with parameters for an EEU,
users can call two functions
(\texttt{ReboundTools::load\_eeu\_data()} and \texttt{ReboundTools::rebound\_analysis()})
to perform all rebound calculations described in this paper.
The function \texttt{ReboundTools::path\_graphs()} creates
rebound paths in the energy, expenditure, and consumption planes.
Extensive documentation for \texttt{ReboundTools}
can be found at \url{https://matthewheun.github.io/ReboundTools/}.

In addition, an Excel workbook that performs identical rebound calculations
using the framework of this paper
**** will be stored at the
Research Data Leeds Repository if this submission is accepted.
The spreadsheet file is included with the submission of this paper. ****

\section{Results}

In this section we present rebound calculation results for two examples:
energy efficiency upgrades of a car (Section~\ref{sec:car_example}) and
an electric lamp (Section~\ref{sec:lamp_example}).
Univariate sensitivity studies for both examples (car and lamp)
can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:sensitivity_analyses}.

\subsection{Example 1: Purchase of a new car}
\label{sec:car_example}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Armed with the data in
Tables~\ref{tab:car_parameters}--\ref{tab:car_elasticity_parameters},
and the equations in Section~\ref{PartI-sec:framework} of Part~I,
we calculate important values at each rebound stage,
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:car_stages_table}.
Note that Table~\ref{tab:car_stages_table} applies to the car user.
Across the macro effect (segment \bartilde{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph}),
changes occur only in the macroeconomy.
For the car user, no changes are recorded across the macro effect.
Thus, the $-$ (bar) and $\sim$ (tilde) columns
of Table~\ref{tab:car_stages_table} are identical.
Rebound components for the car upgrade are shown in Table~\ref{tab:car_results}.
Figs.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph}--\ref{fig:CarConsGraph}
show energy, expenditure, and consumption planes
for the car example.

The \empleffect{} has three components:
the direct emplacement effect,
the embodied energy effect, and
the combined operations, maintenance, and disposal effects.
Rebound from the direct emplacement effect
($Re_{dempl}$) is 0.0\% always,
because energy takeback (and, therefore, rebound)
occurs after the upgraded device is emplaced.
Indirect rebound due to the embodied energy effect
($Re_{emb}$) is 1.7\%,
due to the higher embodied energy rate
($\Delta \raempl{E}_{emb} = 429$~MJ/yr)
stemming from the electric battery in the hybrid EV car.
Rebound due to the operations, maintenance, and disposal effects
($Re_{\omd}$) is small and negative
($-3.4$\%),
because of the slightly lower operations, maintenance, and disposal costs
for the hybrid EV car.

The \subeffect{} has two components:
direct and indirect substitution effect rebound.
Rebound from direct substitution ($Re_{dsub}$) is
positive, as expected (10.7\%).
The car user will, on average, prefer more driving purely
from the change in relative prices because of the fuel economy enhancements
(42~mpg $>$ 25~mpg).
In other words,
due the relative price change,
the more fuel-efficient car is driven 7.3\% further
each year.
Conversely, the indirect substitution effect ($Re_{isub}$)
is slightly negative ($-0.9$\%)
to achieve the same level of utility after increased driving.
Indeed, across the substitution effect,
less money is spent on other goods
($\Delta \rasub{C}_o = -74$~\$/yr).
In Appendix~\ref{sec:price_elasticities_sensitivity} we show how the
displacement along an indifference curve alters the price elasticities,
and in particular, that the uncompensated own price elasticity declines
in magnitude. The decline slows the rate of additional consumption of
energy-intensive driving, and attenuates the microeconomic rebound
relative to assuming constant price elasticities.

The \inceffect{} also has two components:
direct and indirect income effect rebound.
The direct income effect
($Re_{dinc}$) is positive
(6.8\%),
because the car user allocates some
net savings to additional driving.
Rebound from the indirect income effect
($Re_{iinc}$) is positive (10.2\%)
due to higher spending on other goods.
Thus, the net savings after the substitution effect
($\rasub{N} = 835$~\$/yr)
translates into positive direct and indirect income
rebound at the microeconomic level.
Total microeconomic rebound (emplacement, substitution, and income effects)
sums to $Re_{micro} = 25.0$\%.

Finally, in Part~I we noted that
the link between macroeconomic and microeconomic rebound
is largely unexplored,
so we assume a value of $k = 1$ for both examples, initially.
We return to the value for $k$
in the Discussion (Section~\ref{sec:calculating_k}).
With $k$ assumed to be 1,
the \macroeffect{} leads to macroeconomic rebound
($Re_{\macro}$) of 10.4\%

due to economic expansion caused by
productivity enhancements arising from the more-efficient provision of the

\subsection{Example 2: Purchase of a new electric lamp}
\label{sec:lamp_example}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With the data in
Tables~\ref{tab:lamp_parameters}--\ref{tab:lamp_elasticity_parameters}
and the equations in Section~\ref{PartI-sec:framework} of Part~I in hand,
we calculate important values at each rebound stage,
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_stages_table}.
Similar to Table~\ref{tab:car_stages_table},
Table~\ref{tab:lamp_stages_table} applies to the lamp user,
so no changes are recorded across the macro effect, and
the $-$ (bar) and $\sim$ (tilde) columns
of Table~\ref{tab:lamp_stages_table} are identical.
Rebound components for the lamp upgrade are shown in Table~\ref{tab:lamp_results}.
Figs.~\ref{fig:LampEnergyGraph}--\ref{fig:LampConsGraph}
show energy, expenditure, and consumption planes
for the lamp example.

The \empleffect{} rebound components start with
the direct emplacement effect ($Re_{dempl}$),
which is always $0.0$\%.
Indirect rebound due to the embodied energy effect
($Re_{emb}$) is $-0.3$\%.
Although the LED lamp has higher embodied energy
($\aempl{E}_{emb} = 6.50$~MJ)
than the incandescent lamp
($\bempl{E}_{emb} = 2.20$~MJ),
the LED lamp has a much longer lifetime,
meaning that the LED embodied energy \emph{rate}
($\raempl{E}_{emb} = 0.65$~MJ/yr)
is less than the incandescent embodied energy rate
($\rbempl{E}_{emb} = 1.22$~MJ/yr).
Thus, the change in embodied energy rate ($\Delta \raempl{E}_{emb}$)
is $-0.57$~MJ/yr,
and embodied energy rebound is negative
($Re_{emb} = -0.3$\%).
Rebound due to the combined operations, maintenance, and disposal effects
($Re_{\omd}$) is 0.0\%,
because we assume no difference in operations, maintenance, or
disposal costs between
the incandescent lamp and the LED lamp.%
\footnote{
  Maintenance cost rates for both incandescent and LED lamps are likely to be equal
  and negligible;
  lamps are usually installed and forgotten.
  Real-world disposal cost differences between the incandescent and LED technologies
  are also likely to be negligible.
  However, if ``disposal'' includes recycling processes,
  cost rates may be different between the two technologies
  due to the wide variety of materials in LED lamps compared to incandescent lamps.
}

Direct \subeffect{} rebound
($Re_{dsub}$) is 17.4\%
due to the much higher LED lamp efficiency
($\amacro{\eta} = 81.8$~lm/W)
compared to the incandescent lamp
($\bempl{\eta} = 8.83$~lm/W),
leading to increased demand for lighting
(from $\rbsub{q}_s = 580,350$~\lmhr/yr
to $\rasub{q}_s = 1,412,867$~\lmhr/yr)
as shown by segment \chat{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:LampConsGraph}.
To maintain constant utility,
consumption of other goods is reduced
($\Delta \rasub{C}_o = -4.15$~\$/yr),
as shown by segment \starc{} in Fig.~\ref{fig:LampConsGraph},
yielding indirect substitution effect rebound
($Re_{isub}$) of $-6.4$\%.

\Inceffect{} rebound arises from spending net energy cost savings
associated with converting from the incandescent lamp to the LED lamp
($\rbinc{N} = 11.30$~\$/yr).
Direct income effect rebound
($Re_{dinc}$) is 0.01\%,
positive but small,
as the lamp user allocates
some of the net savings to additional demand for lighting.
The indirect income effect rebound is large
($Re_{iinc} = 17.3$\%),
due to the energy implications of increased spending on other goods.
Total microeconomic level rebound (emplacement, substitution, and income effects)
sums to $Re_{micro} = 28.1$\%.

Finally, \macroeffect{} rebound
($Re_{\macro}$) is 13.0\%
with $k$ assumed to be 1,
due to economic expansion caused by
productivity enhancements arising from the more-efficient provision of the
energy service (lighting).

\subsection{A first attempt at calculating macro rebound}
\label{sec:calculating_k}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Few previous studies explored the link
between microeconomic and macroeconomic rebound.
Inspired by \citet{Borenstein:2015aa} and others,
the framework developed in Section~\ref{PartI-sec:framework} of Part~I
links macroeconomic rebound to microeconomic rebound
via the macro factor~($k$) that scales
magnitudes in the microeconomic portion of the framework.
(See Section~\ref{PartI-sec:macro_effect_main_paper} of Part~I.)

For the results presented in Section~\ref{sec:results} above,
we assumed a placeholder value of $k = 1$,
meaning that every \$1 of spending by the device user in the income effect
generates only \$1 of additional economic activity in the broader economy.
There are no estimates of $k$, which ultimately traces the aggregate growth
effects of a single, device-specific technical enhancement and is likely
to differ between EEUs. However, using recent empirical estimates of
sectoral multipliers we can ascertain ourselves that $k$ should be different
from 1 and choose a different value in line with those estimates.

Sectoral multipliers capture the impact of sectoral revenue increases
into aggregate demand or GDP growth.
While the idea of scale economies
from larger markets for particular products have a long
history in economic thought dating back at least to \citet{Smith1776},
data from input-output tables and recent advances in network theory
allowed formalization of the spill-overs from sectoral to aggregate growth.
First results show that U.S. aggregate output growth
may have been up to 3 times as large as the growth of the sector in which
growth originated \citep{Foerster2022}.
And industrial policy to
encourage technology adoption in certain sectors was found to pay back
up to 5 times its cost in India, but with wide variation
across sectors \citep{Buera2024}.
Since our problem also concerns technology adoption,
one that features energy augmenting technical change,
we take the value from the \citet{Buera2024} study,
where the majority of multipliers cluster around 3.
Thus, we adopt the value of $k = 3$,
fully aware that this can only be a first approximation.

After setting $k = 3$,
we can recalculate all rebound components in our framework.
Emplacement ($Re_{empl}$), substitution ($Re_{sub}$), and income ($Re_{inc}$) rebound
magnitudes are unchanged after setting $k = 3$.
However, we see that choosing a placeholder value of $k = 1$
resulted in a low value for $Re_{\macro}$ and, therefore, $Re_{tot}$
in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
In Figs.~\ref{fig:CarEnergyGraph} and~\ref{fig:LampEnergyGraph},
the macro effect segments (\bartilde{})
should be three times longer than they appear.
In Tables~\ref{tab:car_results} and~\ref{tab:lamp_results},
the values of macro rebound ($Re_{\macro}$) should triple to
31.2\% and
39.0\%, and
the values of total rebound ($Re_{tot}$) should increase to
56.2\% and
67.0\%
for the car and lamp examples,
respectively.
For the remainder of this paper,
we use $k = 3$.

\subsection{Comparison between the car and lamp case studies}
\label{sec:case_study_comparison}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Tables~\ref{tab:car_results} and~\ref{tab:lamp_results}
and selection of $k = 3$ in Section~\ref{sec:calculating_k}
enable fuller comparisons between the car and lamp examples.
Several points can be made.

First,
the magnitude of every rebound effect is different between the two examples,
the exception being direct emplacement rebound ($Re_{dempl}$)
which is always 0.0\% by definition.
The implication is that every EEU needs to be analyzed separately.
The magnitudes of the rebound effects
for one EEU should never be assumed to apply to a different EEU.

Second,
one cannot know \emph{a-priori} which rebound effects
will be large and which will be small
for a given EEU.
Furthermore, some rebound effects are dependent upon economic parameters,
such as energy intensity ($I_E$).
Thus, it is important to calculate the magnitude of all rebound effects
for each EEU in each economy.

Third,
the two examples illustrate the fact that
embodied energy rebound ($Re_{emb}$) can be positive or negative,
as discussed in Section~\ref{PartI-sec:empl_effect_main_paper} of Part~I.
The car's embodied energy rebound is positive ($1.7$\%)
because of the high embodied energy of the hybrid's battery
relative to the internal combustion engine vehicle.
Although the LED lamp's embodied energy is larger than the
incandescent lamp's embodied energy,
the LED lamp's embodied energy rebound is
small but negative ($-0.3$\%),
due to the longer life of the LED lamp compared to the incandescent lamp.
Thus, each EEU should be analyzed independently for its embodied energy rebound.

Fourth,
macro effect rebound is different between the two examples,
owing to differences in net income ($\raempl{N}$) relative to expected savings ($\Sdot$).
(For the car, $Re_{macro}$ is $31.2$\%.
For the lamp, $Re_{macro}$ is $39.0$\%.)
The efficiency gain for the lamp is far greater than the efficiency gain for the car,
leading to much different rates of net income ($\raempl{N}$) and
different macro rebound values.

\subsection{Comparison to previous rebound estimates}
\label{sec:comparison_to_other_rebound_estimates}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Tables~\ref{tab:rebound_car_comparisons} and~\ref{tab:rebound_lamp_comparisons}
compare car and lamp results (with $k = 3$) to
results from previous studies.
% For punctuation of "rather" here, see https://linguaholic.com/linguablog/comma-before-rather/.
The suite of comparison studies is neither comprehensive nor
definitive of car and lamp EEUs;
rather, they are examples that show the sort of calculations and estimations
carried out in the general literature using a variety of methods.
That said, many of the studies are highly cited,
thereby carrying sufficient academic weight for our purposes.
Tables~\ref{tab:rebound_car_comparisons}
and~\ref{tab:rebound_lamp_comparisons}
and their associated references

First, we see that none of the comparison studies
report all rebound effects considered in this paper.
Also, no previous studies report either emplacement rebound
($Re_{empl} = Re_{emb} + Re_{\omd}$)
or include all of direct and indirect, substitution and
income microeconomic rebound effect combinations.
In addition, none of the other studies report macro rebound ($Re_{macro}$) by itself.
In fact, only 4 and 5 of the 10 studies
in each category (car and lamp, respectively) report total rebound ($Re_{tot}$).
Therefore, by carefully including all rebound components
in the framework and
elucidating all rebound components in Part~II, we are
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

  \item helping to advance conceptual clarity
        in the field of energy rebound, which

  \item may enable future studies to estimate a broader range of rebound components.

\end{enumerate*}

We also observe that studies which provide total rebound
are based on a top-down calculation of overall, economy-wide rebound,
rather than the bottom-up ``sum-of-components'' approach
that we employ.
That finding is instructive.
It supports the view that
a rigorous analysis framework that sets out individual rebound components
has been missing, which
informed the objective for Part~I of this paper.
Further, the finding means that
comparisons between top-down estimations or calculations
of total, economy-wide rebound
may also be of limited value,
because the rebound effects included or excluded may not be clear,
giving an appearance of a ``black box'' calculation approach.%
\footnote{
  That said, without the top-down approaches, 
  we would have few values to compare with our total rebound ($Re_{tot}$).
}

Second, helpful insights can be gained
from comparison of rebound magnitudes and calculation methods.
Greatest alignment between our values and earlier values
appears within the direct (microeconomic) rebound ($Re_{dir}$) column
in Tables~\ref{tab:rebound_car_comparisons} and~\ref{tab:rebound_lamp_comparisons}.
Our car ($17.6$\%) and lamp ($17.4$\%) values
are in the lower half of the comparison studies
for both cases (10\% to 49\% for the car and 10\% to 55\% for the lamp).
This alignment may be due to the easier determination
of direct rebound, from either empirical data
(e.g., \citet{Small:2007aa}) or
via own price elasticities (e.g., \citet{Chitnis:2015}).%
\footnote{
  Also worthy of note is that direct (microeconomic) rebound
  of personal transport may be the most-studied subfield
  in the rebound literature and likely the only topic with enough studies
  to enable meta-reviews such as
  \citet{Sorrell:2009aa},
  \citet{Dimitropoulos:2018aa}, and
  \citet{Gillingham:2020aa}.
}


For indirect rebound ($Re_{indir}$),
there is little agreement on the magnitude of rebound effects.
Our values for
car ($38.6$\%) and
lamp ($49.7$\%) indirect rebound magnitudes
are higher than those found in the comparison studies
for either the car (6\% to 23\%) or the lamp (8\% to 16\%) cases.
The most likely cause of our larger indirect rebound values
is that we include both micro and macro rebound levels,
whereas the comparison studies
focus mainly on microeconomic rebound only
(commonly via cross price elasticities).
In other words,
comparisons of our indirect rebound values with the studies
in Tables~\ref{tab:rebound_car_comparisons} and~\ref{tab:rebound_lamp_comparisons}
may be too simple and not very meaningful,
as we (alone) include macro-level effects in indirect rebound.
If we exclude $Re_{macro}$ from $Re_{indir}$,
our indirect microeconomic rebound values become
7.5\% (car) and
10.7\% (lamp),
which fit within the ranges reported by the
car ($6$\% to $23$\%) and lamp ($-41$\% to $16$\%)
comparison studies.

For total rebound ($Re_{tot}$),
our values of
$56.2$\% (car) and
$67.0$\% (lamp)
are close to those in the comparison studies for both the car (49\% to 51\%) and
lamp (43\% to 51\%) examples.
Beyond that, comparisons (as noted earlier) are inhibited
by methodological differences between previous studies (top-down methods)
and our bottom-up approach for calculating total rebound.

\subsection{Comparison of CES with satiated and
            constant price elasticity (CPE) utility models}
\label{sec:utility_comparison}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++







In Section~\ref{PartI-sec:inc_effect_main_paper} of Part~I,
we showed income-effect rebound expressions
under the limiting condition of already-satiated
consumption of the energy service such that the
income expansion path is a vertical line
in the consumption plane of
Figs.~\ref{fig:CarConsGraph} and~\ref{fig:LampConsGraph}.
Here, we discuss the numerical impact
of the different utility models.

Table~\ref{tab:utility_model_comparison}
compares income-effect rebound under the CES utility model,
the bounding condition of satiated consumption
of the energy service, and
the constant price elasticity (CPE) utility model.%
\footnote{
  The constant price elasticity (CPE) utility model 
  in Table~\ref{tab:utility_model_comparison}
  follows \citet{Borenstein:2015aa} who holds income constant, 
  not utility, 
  when calculating the substitution effect.
  Furthermore, \citeauthor{Borenstein:2015aa}'s income effect
  assumes all post-emplacement freed cash ($\raempl{N}$)
  is spent at the energy intensity of the economy ($I_E$).
}

In the car example, income effect rebound ($Re_{inc}$)
reduces from 17.0\% to
10.6\% when moving from the
CES utility model to the bounding condition of already-satiated
consumption of the energy service.
Total rebound ($Re_{tot}$) goes from
56.2\% to
49.8\%.
On the other hand,
the lamp example shows negligible change
in total rebound ($Re_{tot}$),
moving
from 67.04\%
to 67.03\%.

The reason for the nearly unchanged value
for total rebound ($Re_{tot}$)
in the lamp example is evident in the consumption plane
of Fig.~\ref{fig:LampConsGraph}.
In the CES (homothetic) utility model
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LampConsGraph},
there is almost no income-effect spending
on more of the energy service.
Almost all spending of net income ($\rasub{N}$)
is on other goods.
The path between the $\wedge$ and $-$ points
is nearly vertical already.
In contrast, the path from $\wedge$ to $-$ in the car example
(Fig.~\ref{fig:CarConsGraph})
is decidedly \emph{not} vertical and a reduction in
income-effect rebound ($Re_{inc}$) is observed when
moving from the CES utility model to the bounding condition
of already satiated energy service consumption.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.

Calculation of substitution rebound under the 
constant price elasticity (CPE) utility model, 
which approximates the substitution and income effects 
using only the uncompensated own price elasticity 
of energy service consumption ($\eqspsUC$),
systematically overestimates substitution effect rebound
and underestimates income effect rebound.
That's by construction since income, 
not utility, 
is held constant when calculating substitution
of the energy service for other goods consumption
with the CPE model. 
And the income effect, in the CPE utility model,
allows spending on other goods only, 
which leads to a lower income rebound 
than in the satiated model,
since the absence of compensating variation 
leaves less income to spend.
Once again, 
the specific case determines 
the deviation of the sum of substitution and income rebound
from an exact (in our case, CES) model.
Table~\ref{tab:utility_model_comparison}
shows that while the sum of substitution and income effects 
is 1.4\% smaller for the 
CPE utility model relative to the CES utility model, 
they are nearly the same in the lamp example.

\subsection{Energy price rebound}
\label{sec:price_effect_results}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Appendix~\ref{PartI-sec:price_effect_appendix}
of Part~I, 
Section~\ref{PartI-sec:notes_price_effect}, and
Eq.~(\ref{PartI-eq:Re_p_E})
provide an extension to the framework
involving energy price rebound ($Re_{p_E}$).
This section quantifies energy price rebound
for the car and lamp examples.

To quantify energy price rebound,
data are needed for
personal consumption ($\rorig{E}$)
of the type of energy used by the device,
including energy for the upgraded device and all other devices.
For the car example,
there is typically little other household gasoline consumption
besides for cars,
so we assume $\rorig{E}$ equal to
$\rorig{E}_s/0.95$.
For the lamp example,
a median U.S.\ household consumes about
10,000 kW$\cdot$hr/yr of electricity
\citep{U.S.-Energy-Information-Agency:2023aa}.
Given that there are 2.5 persons per U.S.\ household
\citep{Statista:2024aa},
an individual consumes electricity at a rate of
$\rorig{E} = 4000$~kW$\cdot$hr/yr.

We also need data for the price elasticity
of energy supply ($\varepsilon_{\rate{Q}_E,p_E}$).
For the car case,
we take
the price elasticity of gasoline supply to be 0.29
from \citet{Coyle:2012aa}.
For the lamp case, we adopt the value of
0.33 from \citet[Table~3]{Ghoddusia:2017aa}.

Gray bands provide $\pm 0.1$ range in $\varepsilon_{\rate{Q}_E,p_E}$.}\label{fig:PriceEffectGraph}
\end{figure}

\end{knitrout}


Parameterizing on the fraction of all devices in the economy
that are upgraded ($f_{EEU}$) and
the energy price elasticity of energy supply
($\varepsilon_{\rate{Q}_E,p_E}$) yields
Figure~\ref{fig:PriceEffectGraph}.
As expected,
price-effect rebound ($Re_{p_E}$)
grows as more devices are upgraded,
i.e., as $f_{EEU}$ increases.
Furthermore, inelastic energy supply (smaller $\varepsilon_{\rate{Q}_{E,p_E}}$)
leads to higher price-effect rebound.

In these examples, the car upgrade yields
little additional freed cash beyond the
(slightly) cheaper fuel for the car,
so there is limited spending on other goods and services
and little additional indirect energy demand.
In contrast, the upgrade of the electric lamp
is much more likely to provide energy price rebound,
because electricity for the upgraded lamp is
a small fraction of total electricity consumption
by the consumer.
\emph{All} electricity purchased by the consumer becomes cheaper
when the price of electricity falls due to
widespread lamp upgrades throughout the economy,
leading to freed cash spent on other goods and services
which, themselves, demand energy at the energy intensity
of the economy.



At 100\% penetration of LED lamps ($f_{EEU} = 1$) and
at the nominal energy price elasticity of supply
($\varepsilon_{\rate{Q}_{E},p_E} = 0.33$),
energy price rebound is $Re_{p_E} =
60.9$\%.
Combined with consumer sided rebound of
67.0\%
from Section~\ref{sec:calculating_k},
the sum of consumer-sided and supply-side rebound is
127.9\%,
demonstrating that backfire could occur under conditions
of full penetration of the lamp EEU.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper (Part~II), we help to advance clarity in the field of energy rebound
by
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

  \item developing mutually consistent and numerically precise
        visualizations of rebound effects
        in energy, expenditure, and consumption planes,

  \item operationalizing the macro factor,

  \item documenting in detail new calculations of rebound
        for car and lighting
        upgrades,

  \item showing the extensibility of our framework
        by applying it to estimate energy price rebound, and

  \item providing information about new open source software tools
        for calculating and visualizing rebound
        for any energy efficiency upgrade.

\end{enumerate*}
%
We encourage energy analysts and economists to use visualizations
like the energy, expenditure, and consumption planes
to document rebound calculations going forward.
Our hope is that additional clarity will
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

  \item narrow the gap between economists and energy analysts,

  \item lead to deeper interdisciplinary understanding
        of rebound phenomena, and

  \item enable energy and climate policy
        that takes full account of rebound.

\end{enumerate*}

From the application of the framework in Part~II,
we draw two important conclusions.
First, the car and lamp examples (Section~\ref{sec:results}) show that
        the framework enables
        quantification of rebound magnitudes
        at microeconomic and macroeconomic levels, including
        energy, expenditure, and consumption aspects of
        direct and indirect rebound
        for emplacement, substitution, income, and macro effects.
Second, the examples show that magnitudes of all rebound effects
        vary with the type of EEU performed.
Thus, values for rebound effects
for one EEU should never be assumed to apply to a different EEU, and
it is important to calculate the magnitude of all rebound effects
for each EEU in each economy.

Further work could be pursued in several areas.
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]

  \item Additional empirical studies could be performed
        to calculate the magnitude of different
        rebound effects for a variety of real-life EEUs.

  \item Deeper study of macro rebound is needed,
        including improved determination
        of the value of the macro factor ($k$).

  \item The framework could be used to study the
        distribution of rebound values
        across socioeconomic and demographic groups~\citep{Carroll2017}.

  \item The rebound effects of fossil-energy taxes
        could be studied,
        especially for the web of interconnected dynamic effects
        among rebound components that are functions
        of the energy intensity of the economy ($I_E$).

  \item Sensitivities of rebound components to model parameters
        could be investigated more fully
        than in Appendix~\ref{sec:sensitivity_analyses},
        although this will be challenging work because
        many rebound parameters are covariant.
        For example, post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$)
        is unlikely to be independent of
        post-EEU capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$).

  \item The framework could be extended to encompass
        fuel-switching EEUs, such as the move from
        a gasoline car to an all-electric car.

  \item This framework could be embedded
        in energy-economy models to better include rebound effects
        in discussions of macro energy modeling, energy policy, and
        CO$_2$ emissions mitigation.

Sensitivity analyses show the effect of 
independently varied parameters on total rebound and rebound components.
In the context of this framework,
sensitivity analyses
can show important trends, tendencies, and relationships
between rebound parameters and rebound magnitudes.
Key rebound parameters include 
post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$),
post-EEU capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$),
energy price ($p_E$),
pre-EEU uncompensated price elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqspsUCorig$), 
the macro factor ($k$), and
post-EEU energy service price ($\amacro{p}_s$).
Univariate sensitivity analyses 
(the kind shown here)
should be interpreted carefully,
because some rebound parameters are not expected to be 
independent from others.

\subsection{Effect of post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$) on rebound terms} 
\label{sec:effect_of_efficiency}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


  
Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph} shows that
both the energy takeback rate and expected energy savings ($\Sdot$)
increase with post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$), 
but the relationship is asymptotic.
Each unit increase of fuel economy or lighting efficiency is less effective than
the previous unit increase of fuel economy or lighting efficiency
for saving energy.
At very high levels of fuel economy or lighting efficiency, 
a unit increase leads to almost no additional energy savings.
Thus, we can say there are diminishing returns of fuel economy and lighting efficiency,
leading to saturation of energy savings at very high levels of fuel economy and lighting efficiency.
A simple example illustrates.
A $\bempl{\eta} = 25$ mpg car drives $\bempl{q}_s = 100$ miles 
using $\bempl{E}_s = 4$ gallons of gasoline.
A more-efficient car ($\amacro{\eta} = 30$ mpg) is expected to use
$\aempl{E}_s = 3.33$ gallons to drive the same distance,
a savings of $\Sdot = 0.67$ gallons.
Another 5 mpg boost in efficiency (to $\amacro{\eta} = 35$ mpg)
will use $\aempl{E}_s = 2.86$ gal to drive 100 miles, 
a further expected savings of only $\Sdot = 0.47$ gallons.
Each successive 5~mpg boost in fuel economy 
saves less energy than the previous 5~mpg boost in fuel economy.

\end{figure}

\end{knitrout}
  
  
Saturation can be seen mathematically, too.
Taking the limit as $\amacro{\eta} \rightarrow \infty$ 
in Eq.~(\ref{PartI-eq:Sdot}) of Part~I gives $\Sdot = \rbempl{E}_s$, 
not $\infty$. 
Thus, efficiency saturation must occur.
Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph}
shows that this framework correctly replicates
expected efficiency saturation trends.

Saturation is especially noticeable in the lamp example
compared to the car example,
the difference being that 
the LED lamp is already much more efficient than the incandescent lamp
(9.26$\times$),
whereas the hybrid car is only 
1.68$\times$ more efficient than the conventional gasoline car. 
Thus, at $\amacro{\eta} = 81.8$ \lmhr/\Whr, 
the energy efficient LED
is far closer to efficiency saturation than the hybrid vehicle 
(at $\amacro{\eta} = 42$ mpg).
As a result, further increases in the LED lamp's efficiency 
are less effective than further increases in the hybrid car's efficiency.

That said, actual savings is the difference between the expected energy savings line (solid line)
and the takeback line (dashed line) in Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph}.
Because the gap between the lines grows, 
higher efficiency yields greater energy savings,
even after accounting for rebound effects.
But the actual savings are always less than expected savings, due to takeback.

Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph} shows that
expected energy savings ($\Sdot$) increase faster than takeback 
as $\amacro{\eta}$ increases.
Thus, total rebound ($Re_{tot}$, the ratio of 
takeback rate to expected energy savings rate in Eq.~(\ref{PartI-eq:Re_takeback}) of Part~I),
decreases as efficiency grows.
The lamp exhibits a relatively smaller rebound decline with efficiency,
because the lamp example is closer to saturation than the car example.

Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eta_graph} shows the variation of all rebound components
with post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$).
In the car and lamp examples, 
direct substitution rebound ($Re_{dsub}$) is the 
rebound component 
most sensitive to changes in post-EEU efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$).

Note that the sensitivity analysis on post-upgrade efficiency 
($\amacro{\eta}$, Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eta_graph})
is the only sensitivity analysis that requires careful explication
of both the numerator and denominator of Eq.~(\ref{PartI-eq:Re_takeback}) in Part~I,
as in Fig.~\ref{fig:eta_tilde_takeback_Sdot_sens_graph}, 
because both the numerator and denominator of Eq.~(\ref{PartI-eq:Re_takeback}) in Part~I
change when post-upgrade efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$) changes.
The denominator of Eq.~(\ref{PartI-eq:Re_takeback}) in Part~I doesn't change for
the sensitivity analyses of Figs.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_C_cap_graph}--\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_k_graph}.
Thus, for the remaining sensitivity analyses, 
when the rebound percentage increases (decreases), 
the energy takeback rate in the numerator of Eq.~(\ref{PartI-eq:Re_takeback}) in Part~I
increases (decreases) proportionally,
and the actual energy savings rate decreases (increases) accordingly.

\subsection{Effect of capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$) on rebound terms} 
\label{sec:effect_of_capital_cost}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The sensitivity of energy rebound
to capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$) is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_C_cap_graph}.
All other things being equal,
as capital cost of the EEU rises, 
less net savings result from the emplacement effect,
leading to smaller income, macro, and total rebound.
The same effects would be observed
with increasing maintenance and disposal cost rate ($\ramacro{C}_{\md}$).

\subsection{Effect of energy price ($p_E$) on rebound terms} 
\label{sec:effect_of_energy_price}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++




The effect of energy price on rebound is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_p_E_graph}.
Increasing energy prices lead to larger total rebound ($Re_{tot}$),
because higher energy prices lead to more net savings ($\rasub{N}$)
to be spent by the device user.
All other things being equal, more net savings leads to 
more spending on other goods and services that demand energy.

Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_p_E_graph} also 
shows the effect of energy price ($p_E$)
on all rebound components.
Most rebound components increase with energy price, 
with the car and lamp examples exhibiting different sensitivities. 
Substitution effects ($Re_{dsub}$ and $Re_{isub}$)
are the only rebound components that decrease with energy price ($p_E$).
Substitution effects decrease with energy price, because 
at high energy price, less behavior adjustment is needed to re-equilibrate 
after emplacement of the efficient device.



In Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_p_E_graph}, German energy prices%
\footnote{
  For the car example,
  the gasoline price in Germany is taken as 1.42 \euro{}/liter for the average ``super gasoline'' (95 octane) 
  price in 2018~\citep{finanzen}.
  For the lamp example,
  the electricity price in Germany is taken as 0.3 \euro{}/\kWhr for the 2018 price of a household using 3.5~MWh/yr,
  an average value for German households~\citep{bundesministerium}.
  Converting currency (at 1 \euro{} = \$1.21) and
  physical units gives 
  6.5~\$/US~gallon and 
  0.363~\$/\kWhr.}
%
are shown as vertical lines,
providing an indication of possible energy price variations.
All other things being equal, 
if U.S.\ residents paid Germany's energy prices,
total energy rebound ($Re_{tot}$) would be 
$93.0$\%
for the car example and 
$148.0$\%
for the lamp example.

Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eps_graph} shows the variation of total rebound ($Re_{tot}$)
with the original uncompensated price elasticity of energy service demand ($\eqspsUCorig$).
The effect is exponential, and
total rebound increases with larger negative values of $\eqspsUCorig$, as expected.
The lamp example also shows stronger exponential variation than the car example.
The main reason that total rebound values 
are different between the two examples
is the larger absolute value of original uncompensated own price elasticity ($\eqspsUCorig$) 
for the lamp ($-0.4$) compared to the car ($-0.2$).
Were the car to have the same original uncompensated own price elasticity
as the lamp (i.e., $-0.4$), 
total rebound would be closer for both examples 
($73.4$\% for the car and 
$67.0$\% for the lamp).
Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eps_graph} shows that direct substitution rebound 
($Re_{dsub}$) is the most sensitive rebound component to changes in $\eqspsUC^\circ$.
For the lamp example, indirect income rebound ($Re_{iinc}$) also increases
substantially with $\eqspsUC^\circ$, 
because net savings increases substantially with $\eqspsUC^\circ$.

\subsection{Effect of macro factor ($k$) on rebound terms} 
\label{sec:effect_of_macro_factor}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The sensitivity of energy rebound 
to the macro factor ($k$) is shown 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_k_graph}.
The macro factor has a linear effect on total rebound ($Re_{tot}$)
through the macro rebound component ($Re_{\macro}$).
All other rebound components are constant when $k$ is varied independently.

\subsection{Effect of discount rate ($r$) on rebound terms} 
\label{sec:effect_of_discount_rate}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The effect of discount rate on rebound is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_r_graph}.
Discounting has little effect on rebound terms
compared to other parameters such as
upgraded efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}$, Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eta_graph}), 
capital cost ($\amacro{C}_{cap}$, Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_C_cap_graph}), 
energy price ($p_E$, Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_p_E_graph}), and 
own price elasticity of energy service demand 
($\eqspsUCorig$, Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eps_graph}).

\subsection{Effect of energy service price ($\amacro{p}_s$) on price elasticities ($\asub{\varepsilon}$)}
\label{sec:price_elasticities_sensitivity}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The sensitivity of post-substitution effect price elasticities ($\asub{\varepsilon}$)
to post-upgrade energy service price ($\amacro{p}_s$)
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PriceElasticitySensGraph}
for the CES utility model described 
in Section~\ref{PartI-sec:sub_effect_main_paper} 
and Appendix~\ref{PartI-sec:utility_and_elasticities}
of Part~I.
Note that the left side of each graph ($\amacro{p}_{s} = 0$)
represents unattainable infinite efficiency ($\amacro{\eta}_s \rightarrow \infty$), 
i.e., delivery of the energy service without energy consumption.

First, note the sign of the elasticities. As expected, both of the
uncompensated price elasticities ($\eqspsUChat$ and $\eqopsUChat$,
dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:PriceElasticitySensGraph}) 
are negative, regardless of the energy service price ($\amacro{p}_s$):
a lower price means more consumption of both
goods, all other things being equal.
The compensated own price elasticity ($\eqspsChat$) is negative
and the compensated cross price elasticity ($\eqopsChat$) is positive.
As $\amacro{p}_s$ declines, the consumers substitutes the energy
service for other goods.

\caption{Sensitivity of post substitution effect price elasticities ($\asub{\varepsilon}$) to post-EEU energy service price ($\amacro{p}_{s}$) for the CES utility model. This graph is a visualization of Eqs.~\ref{PartI-eq:eqopsC_exact}, \ref{PartI-eq:eqopsUC_exact}, \ref{PartI-eq:eqspsC_exact}, and \ref{PartI-eq:eqspsUC_exact} of Part~I. The solid vertical line indicates the original energy service price ($\orig{p}_s$), and the dashed vertical line indicates the upgraded energy service price ($\aempl{p}_s = \asub{p}_s = \ainc{p}_s = \amacro{p}_s$) for the two examples. See Tables~\ref{tab:car_stages_table} and \ref{tab:lamp_stages_table} for $p_s$ in different units.}\label{fig:PriceElasticitySensGraph}

Second, the magnitude of price elasticities varies.
Fig.~\ref{fig:PriceElasticitySensGraph} shows that the car example exhibits
more variation of price elasticities ($\asub{\varepsilon}$) with energy service price ($\amacro{p}_s$)
than the lamp example, 
because the expenditure share ($\fCs$) for the lamp example is very small
compared to the car example.
Using the constant price elasticity (CPE) utility model may be a
good enough approximation in the lamp example. 
However, for the car example, using the CES utility function will be necessary
to eliminate errors that will be present in the CPE approximation.
This result is an important finding that should encourage 
analysts implementing analytical rebound calculations
with substitution and income effects
to prefer the CES utility model over the CPE approximation.

Fig.~\ref{fig:PriceElasticitySensGraph} shows that
as efficiency increases (and $\amacro{p}_s$ decreases), 
the absolute value of the uncompensated price elasticities 
($\eqspsUChat$ and $\eqopsUChat$) decreases, 
a change that exceeds the slightly increasing (in absolute value terms)
compensated own price elasticity ($\eqspsChat$). 
Thus, direct rebound is attenuated as efficiency increases,
relative to a constant price elasticity model.
(See also the patterns of lines of Fig.~\ref{fig:all_Re_terms_eta_graph},
which show a declining trend.)
