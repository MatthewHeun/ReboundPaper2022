Differences are indicated by the Greek letter $\Delta$ and always
signify subtraction of a quantity at an earlier stage of Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}
from the same quantity at the next later stage of Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}.
E.g.,
$\Delta \ainc{X} \equiv \ainc{X} - \binc{X}$, and
$\Delta \amacro{X} \equiv \amacro{X} - \bmacro{X}$.
Lack of decoration on a difference term indicates a difference that spans all stages of Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}.
E.g., $\Delta X \equiv \amacro{X} - \orig{X}$.
$\Delta X$ is also the sum of differences across each stage in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart},
as shown below.

\begin{align}
\Delta X &= \Delta \amacro{X} + \Delta \ainc{X} + \Delta \asub{X} + \Delta \aempl{X} \nonumber \\
\Delta X &= (\amacro{X} - \bmacro{X}) + (\ainc{X} - \binc{X})
            + (\asub{X} - \bsub{X}) + (\aempl{X} - \bempl{X}) \nonumber \\
\Delta X &= (\amacro{X} - \cancel{\bmacro{X}}) + (\cancel{\ainc{X}} - \cancel{\binc{X}})
            + (\cancel{\asub{X}} - \cancel{\bsub{X}}) + (\cancel{\aempl{X}} - \bempl{X}) \nonumber \\
\Delta X &= \amacro{X} - \orig{X}
\end{align}
