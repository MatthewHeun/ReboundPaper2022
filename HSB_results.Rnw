%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper (Part~II), we develop the first visualizations of 
rebound path graphs in energy, expenditure, and consumption spaces
to bridge gaps between economists and energy analysts.
And we operationalize and calibrate the macro factor ($k = 3$)
to provide a link between effects at microeconomic and macroeconomic scales,
missing from previous partial equilibrium frameworks. 

With novel visualizations of rebound paths and ****
we advance the analytical foundations for empirical estimates of rebound and
facilitate interdisciplinary understanding of rebound phenomena
toward the goal of enabling of more robust rebound estimates
for sound energy and climate policy.

From the development and application of the framework in Part~II, 
we draw four important conclusions.
First, the car and lamp examples (Section~\ref{sec:examples}) show that
        the framework enables
        quantification of rebound magnitudes at microeconomic and macroeconomic scales, including 
        direct and indirect locations 
        for emplacement, substitution, income, and macro effects.
Second, the examples show that magnitudes of rebound effects
        vary with the type of EEU performed.


Future work:
Assess rebound sensitivities, which will be challenging work because
many rebound parameters are interlinked. 
**** examples of interlinking here ****.


Future work could be pursued in several areas. 
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\roman*)}]
	
  \item Other utility models (besides the CES utility model) 
        could be explored for the substitution effect.
  
  \item Further empirical studies could be performed
        to estimate the magnitude of different 
        rebound effects in a variety of real-life EEUs.

  \item Deeper study of macro rebound is needed, including improved estimates 
        for the macro factor ($k$) and its relation to the MPC.
        
  \item The rebound implications of the distribution of $\MPC$ values 
        across socioeconomic groups~\citep{Carroll2017}
        could be explored.

  \item The rebound effects of fossil-energy taxes 
        could be studied further,
        especially for the web of interconnected dynamic effects
        among rebound components that are functions
        of the energy intensity of the economy ($I_E$).
